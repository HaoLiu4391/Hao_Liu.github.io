<br />
This is the homepage of Hao Liu (刘好), a junior undergraduate from Tsinghua University, majoring computer science. This summer I'll be at MIT Brain & Cognition Department as a visiting student.

The ONLY & ULTIMATE goal for my research is to understand how brain works and what is consciousness. My research interests cover a wide range of fields related to Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning, including Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Reinforcement Learning. I'm also tring to explore more on Neuroscience and Psychology, including fields like Spiking Neural Networks, Consciousness Modelling and so on. Now I'm focusing on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with (Natural Language) Communicaiton.

I conduct scientific research from a humanistic perspective and through methods of simulation, driven by curiosity.

Education Background
======

2014-2020 Tianjin No.1 High School

2020-2024 Tsinghua University

Research & Learning Background
======

* During High School (2017-2020), I was supervised by Prof. Mingming Cheng and Shaoping Lu at NanKai University, learning about Computer Vision. I built a pollution image classification system using hand-designed features.

* Invited High School Student at CHINA THEORY WEEK 2018 (CTW2018).

* Freshman year (2020-2021), I was at Prof. Minlie Huang's CoAI group, learning and experimenting LLMs and prompt learning.

* Sophomore year (2021-2022), <br />I built a finetuned QA model using database querying under Prof. Minlie Huang's guidence.
                              <br />I built a Chinese stock market prediction large model during my SRT project, working with Penghan Wang, Qingchen Liu and under Prof. Maosong Sun's guidence.
                              <br />I built a 3D diffusion model using a self-defined transformer structure on generating Protein structure using [sidechain dataset](https://pypi.org/project/sidechainnet/), before [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.15611.pdf) came out.
                              <br />I also explored other areas such as: 
                                                                   <br />- image super resolution (during summer 2022, guided by Menghao Guo)
                                                                   <br /> - PairWise Learning and Meta Learning (during summer 2022, guided by Prof. Zhiting Hu)
                                                                   <br /> - Self-Supervised learning in Computer Vision (MIM and Comparison Learning etc., inspired Kaiming and Lecun's work)
                                                                   <br /> - Conscious Modelling (Global Workspace Theory etc. , inspired by M.Blum and Bengio's work)
                                                                 
* Junior year (2022-2023), <br />I built a Trade Network Prediction system using [Non-Parametric Transformer](https://github.com/OATML/Non-Parametric-Transformers), based on tabular data form and using a product-level dataset [BACI](http://cepii.fr/cepii/en/bdd_modele/bdd_modele_item.asp?id=37).
                           <br />Now I'm currently doing project's related to Multi-Agent Language Emergence and Communication at BIGAI and I'll be at MIT Brain & Cognition Department doing similar topic this summer.
