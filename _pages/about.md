<br />
This is the homepage of Hao Liu (刘好). Now I'm a second year graduate student at NYU psychology, working closely with Prof. [Sebastian Michelmann](https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/sebastian-michelmann.html) and Prof. [Marcelo Mattar](https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/marcelo-mattar.html) on Memory and Learning. Formerly, I got my Bachelor of Computer Science from Tsinghua University, supervised by Prof. [Hang Su](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/info/1313/4403.htm). I was also an exchange student at MIT, working in Prof. [Joshua Tenenbaum](https://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html)'s group with Prof. [Tianmin Shu](https://www.tshu.io/).

The goal for my research is to understand how brain works and what is consciousness. My research interests cover a wide range of fields related to Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning, including Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Reinforcement Learning. I'm also tring to explore more on Neuroscience and Psychology, including topics like Theory of Mind, Spiking Neural Networks, Chaotic Attractors, Consciousness Modelling, Multiagent & Game Theory and so on. I'm a big fan of research in Cellular Automata. 

I read and learn math and philosophy as well. Expecially for topics like Algebraic Topology, Fractal Geometry, Philosophy of Logic and Philosophy of Mind (Perception & Consciousness)

Now I'm focusing on __computational modeling for distributed memory system__.

I conduct scientific research from a humanistic perspective and through methods of simulation, driven by curiosity.

Research & Learning Background
======

* During High School (2017-2020), I was supervised by Prof. [Mingming Cheng](https://mmcheng.net/cmm/) and [Shaoping Lu](https://www.shaopinglu.net/) at NanKai University, learning about Computer Vision. I built a pollution image classification system using hand-designed features.

* Invited High School Student at CHINA THEORY WEEK 2018 (CTW2018).

* Freshman year (2020-2021), I was at Prof. Minlie Huang's CoAI group, learning and experimenting LLMs and prompt learning.

* Sophomore year (2021-2022), <br />I built a finetuned QA model using database querying under Prof. Minlie Huang's guidence.
                              <br />I built a Chinese stock market prediction large model during my SRT project, working with Penghan Wang, Qingchen Liu and under Prof. Maosong Sun's guidence.
                              <br />I built a 3D diffusion model using a self-defined transformer structure on generating Protein structure using [sidechain dataset](https://pypi.org/project/sidechainnet/), before [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.15611.pdf) came out.
                              <br />I also explored other areas such as: 
                                                                   <br />- image super resolution (during summer 2022, guided by Menghao Guo)
                                                                   <br /> - PairWise Learning and Meta Learning (during summer 2022, guided by Prof. Zhiting Hu)
                                                                   <br /> - Self-Supervised learning in Computer Vision (MIM and Comparison Learning etc., inspired by Kaiming and Lecun's work)
                                                                   <br /> - Conscious Modelling (Global Workspace Theory etc. , inspired by M.Blum and Bengio's work)
                                                                 
* Junior year (2022-2023), <br />I built a Trade Network Prediction system using [Non-Parametric Transformer](https://github.com/OATML/Non-Parametric-Transformers) with Qingchen Liu, based on tabular data form and using a product-level dataset [BACI](http://cepii.fr/cepii/en/bdd_modele/bdd_modele_item.asp?id=37).
                           <br />At MIT Brain & Cognition Department, doing project's related to Multi-Agent Language Communication and the Theory Of Mind(TOM), supervised by Postdoc Tianmin Shu.
                           <br />At BIGAI, for projects about multiagent learning in social environment, RL and evolution learning. We proposed an Adaptive Environment with Social Structures for Multi-Agent Decision-Making. Now this paper is published at [NIPS 2024 benchmark track](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2024/poster/97511)

* Senior year (2023-2024), <br /> I did multiagent reinforcement learning with emergency communication with Prof. Hang Su, We want to generalize beyond Traditional Referential Game setting, using a multiagent interactive, cooperative environment setting.
                           <br /> I used LLM for anomaly detection for malicious transaction in BlockChain, I did this during I was a intern at [Sec3](https://www.sec3.dev/), using Solana Dataset. This research is guided by Prof. [Wenbo Guo](https://henrygwb.github.io/) and Prof. [Xingyu Xing](http://xinyuxing.org/). Now the paper is out on arxiv: BlockFound: [Customized blockchain foundation model for anomaly detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04039).

* Master years (2024-2026), <br /> I used diffusion model and diffusion inversion as a generative approach to model how information in stored and compressed in our memory system. Specificlly, the encoding and reinstatement process from neo-crotex to hippocampus. I did behaviour correlation of the model ([mnemonic similarity task](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6991464/)), as well as neuron correlation of the model([Natural Scenes Dataset](https://naturalscenesdataset.org/)).
                            <br /> I also tried to explore Heretical reinforcement learning and meta reinforcement learning for task representations and goal compositionality in sparce-rewarded environment.
