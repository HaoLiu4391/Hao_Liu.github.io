<br />
This is the homepage of Hao Liu (刘好). Now I'm a graduate student at NYU psychology, working closely with Prof. [Sebastian Michelmann](https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/sebastian-michelmann.html) and Prof. [Noga Zaslavsky](https://www.nogsky.com/) on Memory and Learning. Formerly, I got my Bachelor of Computer Science from Tsinghua University, supervised by Prof. [Hang Su](https://www.suhangss.me/). I was also an exchange student at MIT, working in Prof. [Joshua Tenenbaum](https://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html)'s group with Prof. [Tianmin Shu](https://www.tshu.io/).

The goal for my research is to understand how brain works and what is consciousness. My research interests cover a wide range of fields related to Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning, including Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Reinforcement Learning. I'm also tring to explore more on Neuroscience and Psychology, including fields like Thoery of Mind, Spiking Neural Networks, Attractor modelings, Consciousness Modelling and so on. Now I'm focusing on computational modeling for Complement Learning Systems in our memory.

Currently, my interests shift to research from a neuroscience and mathematical perspective. Now i'm learning biological nerual network modeling, Category theory for machine learning and Evolutionary learning. (2023.9.11)
Now, my research interests are including: 1) Chaotic Theory for neuron modeling. (Including Fractal geometry related.)
                                          2) 


I conduct scientific research from a humanistic perspective and through methods of simulation, driven by curiosity.

2014-2020 Tianjin No.1 High School

2020-2024 Tsinghua University

Research & Learning Background
======

* During High School (2017-2020), I was supervised by Prof. Mingming Cheng and Shaoping Lu at NanKai University, learning about Computer Vision. I built a pollution image classification system using hand-designed features.

* Invited High School Student at CHINA THEORY WEEK 2018 (CTW2018).

* Freshman year (2020-2021), I was at Prof. Minlie Huang's CoAI group, learning and experimenting LLMs and prompt learning.

* Sophomore year (2021-2022), <br />I built a finetuned QA model using database querying under Prof. Minlie Huang's guidence.
                              <br />I built a Chinese stock market prediction large model during my SRT project, working with Penghan Wang, Qingchen Liu and under Prof. Maosong Sun's guidence.
                              <br />I built a 3D diffusion model using a self-defined transformer structure on generating Protein structure using [sidechain dataset](https://pypi.org/project/sidechainnet/), before [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.15611.pdf) came out.
                              <br />I also explored other areas such as: 
                                                                   <br />- image super resolution (during summer 2022, guided by Menghao Guo)
                                                                   <br /> - PairWise Learning and Meta Learning (during summer 2022, guided by Prof. Zhiting Hu)
                                                                   <br /> - Self-Supervised learning in Computer Vision (MIM and Comparison Learning etc., inspired by Kaiming and Lecun's work)
                                                                   <br /> - Conscious Modelling (Global Workspace Theory etc. , inspired by M.Blum and Bengio's work)
                                                                 
* Junior year (2022-2023), <br />I built a Trade Network Prediction system using [Non-Parametric Transformer](https://github.com/OATML/Non-Parametric-Transformers) with Qingchen Liu, based on tabular data form and using a product-level dataset [BACI](http://cepii.fr/cepii/en/bdd_modele/bdd_modele_item.asp?id=37).
                           <br />Now I'm currently at MIT Brain & Cognition Department, in Joshua Tenenbaum's group, doing project's related to Multi-Agent Language Communication and the Theory Of Mind(TOM), supervised by Postdoc Tianmin Shu.
                           <br />I'll be back at BIGAI this autumn for projects about multiagent learning in social environment, RL and evolution learning.
